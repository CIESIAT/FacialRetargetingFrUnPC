## This repository is created for SMI paper 4.




The visualization tool utilizes the method proposed in the paper, which will be released here upon the paper’s acceptance.

This visualization tool is built on the caszm medical simulation software and was co-developed by Di Wu(d.wu@siat.ac.cn) and Yuping Ye(yeahpingye@gmail.com) from SIAT, along with the caszm team(http://www.caszm.com/).
SPACE key is shortkey to viewer Locker

The tool also can be download with baiduDisk：

abstract = {Facial retargeting is a widely used technique in the game and film industries that replicates the expressions of a source facial model onto a target model. Existing methods for facial retargeting rely on either hand-crafted uniform triangle meshes or sparse points obtained from motion capture(mocap). In this paper, we propose an end-to-end facial retargeting algorithm that copies facial expressions from unordered dense point clouds onto the target model. First, a corresponding building method based on bi-harmonic function is introduced to ensure that the template model and a cluster of point clouds share the same triangle topology. Second, a deformation transferring method is presented to transfer the calculated deformation onto the target model. Several experiments are conducted on the SIAT-3DFE dataset to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method.}
