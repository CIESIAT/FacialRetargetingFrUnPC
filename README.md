## This repository is created for SMI paper 4.

The visualization tool utilizes the method proposed in the paper, which will be released here upon the paper’s acceptance.

This visualization tool is based on the caszm medical simulation software and was co-developed by Di Wu(d.wu@siat.ac.cn) and Yuping Ye(yeahpingye@gmail.com) from SIAT, along with the caszm team(http://www.caszm.com/).

The tool also can be download with baiduDisk：
